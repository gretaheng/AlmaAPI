This script is used to update portfolios in the Elsever EBA collection. At the end of each academic year, SDSU chooses part of the titles in the EBA subscribed title list and purchase them with perpetual access. The script helps to match the portfolios' isbn with the ISBN that vendor provides for the final purchase and update the access type. One needs to have the portfolio exported from Alma and have the final purchased titles' ISBN. Please be noted the ISBN that vendor provides may not the one in the 020 field. So we include the ISBN in the URL to match as well.
